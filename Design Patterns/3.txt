a) Decorator Pattern
	Just as the problem expects, decorator pattern is used to add more features to an existing class,
	without changing the structure of the existing class. Hence Decorator Design Pattern is the best suited in this case.
	
	Using the Decorator Pattern, we will create a wrapper class that holds an object of the ComputerEquipment class,
	along with the additional operations. Hence we have an enhanced class without tempering with the original class,
	and without rewriting the original class.
